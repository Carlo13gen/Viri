This is README-win32.bin file for BLAG 2.1 binary distribution
==============================================================

This directory contains a precompiled version of BLAG for Windows.
The directory contains the following files:

- README-win32.bin  : this file.
- graph             : a sample input graph in GDT format (only topology) 
- blag.exe          : the BLAG executable for the windows platform
- blag.ini          : a sample ini file instructing blag about the 
                      layout to be generated
- run_me.bat         : a DOS batch file launching blag on the sample graph.

In order to test blag.exe, just run the run_me.bat batch file.
The following files should be generated:

- graph.exp     : the output layout in export simplified format;
- graph.gdt     : the output layout in GDT internal format;
- gdt_report    : a log of the algorithmic steps performed;
- gdt_test_true : a flag file to acknowledge that the algorithm
                  specified in the blag.ini file could be
                  applied on the input graph. 

Please refer to the BLAG documentation at http://www.dia.uniroma3.it/~gdt
for writing your own input graphs and ini files.
